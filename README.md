# laser_game

At this stage of development we have made the core loop of the game. 
This demo is the first level of our game where you can see how the game should be played. The demo starts of with two buttons in both corners that both players need to step in each button without dying from the lasers to progress to the next level. Of course the second level has not been created. 

The lasers blink a couple of times to warn the players before the blast. There are clear sounds to the lasers also so you can hear when they start. We have win and lose conditions.
